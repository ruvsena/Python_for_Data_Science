# Python_for_Data_Science

This repository contains a collection of data science case studies that I completed as part of the Miuul Python for Data Science course. Each Case Studyies demonstrates the application of various data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization techniques using Python. The case studies were independently completed to reinforce the concepts learned during the course. The code is organized in Jupyter notebooks, making it easy to follow the analysis step-by-step. Feel free to explore the projects and provide any feedback or suggestions!
